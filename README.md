# Lab 18: Cryptography

## Overview

- Devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key.
- Devise a way to decipher the encrypted message event when you do NOT have the key!

## Feature Tasks

- Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift.  
- Create a decrypt function that takes in encrypted text and numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form when correct key is supplied.  
- Create a crack function that will decode the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state WITHOUT access to the key.  
- Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.
